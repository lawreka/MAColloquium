       <div class="infotext">The conclusion of this chapter states: even if the agent or product does not have a humanoid embodiment, the psychological effect of pareidolia can be used to imply a human face and encourage a human-like or social interaction. Through studies of robot facial features and product designs, <strong>the minimum facial features required are eyes, which ideally should be as large and detailed as possible.</strong> The addition of eyebrows, nose, mouth, and cheeks will greatly enhance the anthropomorphic effect and can be used in emotional communication.
