       <div class="titletext">Realism: conclusions</div>
       <div class="infotext">Realism has to do choosing a rendering or illustration style for the agent. For example, the Uncanny Valley is a well-known phenomenon when a human-like robot or toy looks lifelike enough that it gives a creepy feeling to the user. The conclusion of this chapter states: for social robots, producing expressiveness and adding biological features such as skin can be a death sentence. <strong>A high level of realism is not necessary for an effective design.</strong> The Uncanny Valley effect can be overcome by aesthetic considerations, particularly by making the agent sexually appealing, but the aesthetic of sexual desirability will be inappropriate for most conversational agents whose main function is not as a sexual partner and companion.
