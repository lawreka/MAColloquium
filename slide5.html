       <div class="infotext">Embodiment types have been broken into three categories: humans, animals and objects, and robotic bodies. The conclusion of this chapter states: no matter how designers try to create unbiased representations, there will be unintended social consequences of selecting the agent's gender, race, and social signifiers, and designing against the potential for abuse. In order to avoid reproducing stereotypical representations and to remove the possibility for users to normalize abuse and harassment of humanoid technology, <strong>human embodiments are found to be a less desirable design choice than nonhuman or robotic embodiments</strong>.
