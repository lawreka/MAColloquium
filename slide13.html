       <div class="infotext">Throughout the written component of the thesis I analyzed existing conversational agents to find out what worked and did not work in their design, where they fit along the spectrums of embodiment, anthropomorphism, realism, and situation, and drew conclusions to inform the E.A.R.S. framework.

      <br>
      Case Studies included: Mitsuku, Clippy, Mavis Beacon, Replika, Woebot, MacOS Finder, Cozmo, Realbotix Harmony AI, Poncho, Gatebox, and Ask Jeeves.
      <br>
      <br>
      At the end of each study I exercised the conclusion on my generic agent character.
